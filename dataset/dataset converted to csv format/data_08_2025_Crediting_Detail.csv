Alberta Emission Offset System,Governmental,Implemented,2007,Subnational,Alberta,"Alberta’s greenhouse gas reduction framework including the implementation of its carbon offset crediting system was established in 2007. To be eligible for crediting, all activities must take place within the province of Alberta and meet a number of other system requirements including having a government-approved quantification protocol for the emission reduction activity. 

The Canadian federal government recognizes the Alberta Emission Offset System under a number of approved protocols to supply a source of credits (called Recognized Units) to the federal-regulated facilities under the federal output-based pricing system program since August 2020. The federal output-based pricing system does not apply in Alberta. 

Other credit types include:
• Emission performance credits, created by regulated facilities whose emissions are less than their allocations; 
• Associated Emission Offset: Sequestration credits, which occur from converting emission offsets from deep saline aquifer sequestration or enhanced oil recovery and enable the underlying activity to also participate in generating credits under Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations; and
• Capture recognition tonnes, which are converted sequestration credits and can be applied at a regulated facility that captured the carbon dioxide as if it was an on-site reduction.
","The TIER Regulation was amended effective January 1, 2023, and updated a number of requirements for regulated facilities and Alberta emission offset projects. Related to credits, amendments include a phased-in increase in credit use limit (rising from 60% maximum in 2023 by 10% per year until it reaches 90% in 2026), reducing the credit expiry period to 5 years, additional reviews for project credit extensions, and the establishment of two new credit types – sequestration credits and capture recognition tonnes – to support carbon capture and storage business models. The guidance and requirements of the offset system are also updated including the Standard for Greenhouse Gas Emission Offset Project Developers (version 3.2, released April 28, 2023) and the Carbon Offset Emission Factor Handbook.

-	For offsetting, there may be a maximum of three years between the year of reduction of the emissions used to compensate and the year in which the taxed emissions are generated.
-	The mitigation initiatives generating eligible carbon credits shall be aligned with the country’s NDC.
-	Emissions may only be offset by implementing projects to reduce emissions of the same pollutant. 
-	Offset projects must be located within Chile. Entities seeking to compensate for their particulate matter emissions must invest in projects located in the same area as the emitting installation.

Panama Crediting Mechanism,Governmental,Under development,,National,Panama,"On December 2021, Executive Decree 142 created the legal structure for the National Carbon Market of Panama (Mercado Nacional de Carbono de Panamá, MNCP), outlining concrete steps for its operations, defined its main components, and created its governing structures. Through MNCP, entities will be able to offset their greenhouse gas emissions, voluntarily acquiring carbon credits from compensation projects at the national level to contribute to low-emission development that is resilient to climate change.

The MNCP will promote a low-emissions economy, based on the purchase and sale of National Emissions Reduction Units (Unidades Nacionales de Reducción de Emisiones, UNRE). 

The three main components of the MNCP are:
•	National GHG management programs under the National Reduce Your Footprint Program (Reduce Tu Huella, PNRTH) 
•	National Offsetting Mechanism of Panama (Sistema Nacional de Compensación de Gases de Efecto Invernadero de Panamá, SNCP) 
•	Panama Carbon Exchange (Bolsa Panameña del Carbono, BPC)

Eligible entities participating in the National Reduce Your Footprint Program (PNRTH) will represent the demand for UNREs resulting from national compensation projects aimed at offsetting or neutralizing their carbon footprint. The SNCP will establish a process for obtaining UNREs, and the Panama Carbon Exchange (BCP) will serve as the marketing platform. Prices for the purchase and sale of UNREs have not yet been determined.
