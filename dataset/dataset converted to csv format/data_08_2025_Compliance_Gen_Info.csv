It covers large emitting facilities, with the ability for lower emitting facilities to opt in to the regulation. 
 
Covered entities must reduce their emissions intensity (emissions per unit of production) by a set percentage each year. The reduction requirement is based on a facility’s average emissions intensity over a three-year historic period or compared to a sector-specific benchmark. Covered entities that outperform their targets generate emissions performance credits (EPCs), which can be sold or used in future compliance years. Those that exceed their limits are required to provide compensation by either (1) purchasing EPCs from other covered facilities, (2) paying into the TIER fund to purchase a fund credit for each tonne of excess emissions, or (3) purchasing emission offset credits generated within Alberta under an approved offset protocol or sequestration credits. ","Alberta’s Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) Regulation was amended in December 2022, with changes taking effect on January 1, 2023. Updates included setting the carbon price in line with the federal benchmark; tightening output-based benchmarks by 2% annually from 2023 to 2030 and also increasing the tightening rates of the oil sands sectors by 4% in 2029 and 2030; reducing the opt-in threshold to 2,000 tonne  per year; increasing the limits on emission performance and offsets usage from 60% in 2023 by 10% annually until it reaches 90% in 2026; reducing the credit expiry to five years; establishing sequestration credits and capture recognition tonnes  to support carbon capture, utilization, and storage investments; and changing the biomass emissions treatment to support bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.
","Alberta’s TIER Regulation applies to all greenhouse gas emissions from facilities that emit 100 ktCO2-e/year or more, including industry, power, food processing, waste and other sectors. Smaller conventional oil and gas facilities can aggregate and opt-in to the regulation. Lower emitting facilities (those emitting 2,000 tonnes CO2e or more per year) can opt-in to the regulation.

Facility-level baselines are calculated using output-based benchmarking based on emissions intensity.  
 
Facilities emitting above their baseline must offset excess emissions by surrendering Safeguard Mechanism Credits (SMCs) or Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs). In some cases, facilities can also apply to average their emissions over a longer period or borrow from a future year.  
 
The Safeguard Mechanism was introduced in 2016 but had not been classified as a baseline-and-credit system as no tradeable permits were issued. However, as of July 2023, the government issues SMCs to facilities that over-achieve on their baseline. This reform was accompanied by a tightening of baselines and a default decline rate of 4.9% per year, to align the outcome with Australia’s 2030 targets.
","Legislation to reform the Safeguard Mechanism was passed in March 2023, with changes entering into force from July 2023. The Safeguard Mechanism now assigns emissions baselines to over 200 large facilities, with those emitting above their baseline required to offset excess emissions. The reforms tightened emissions baselines for covered facilities and now allow the issuance of credits to facilities that overachieve on their baseline. This in effect turned the Safeguard Mechanism into a baseline-and-credit system. 
","The Safeguard Mechanism covers all direct (scope 1) GHG emissions from facilities emitting over 100kt CO2-e/year in electricity, mining, oil and gas production, manufacturing, transport and waste.

Although the NEHG does not establish a carbon tax, the carbon pricing instrument follows in central parts the logic of existing energy taxes (fuel tax, coal tax, and natural gas tax). Thus, if a certain event is taxable under the existing energy taxes regime, an obligation to buy allowances arises under the NEHG. Taxable events are the production, import, or release of energy products from a tax warehouse in Austria or the supply of coal and natural gas to consumers. In practice, only a limited number of energy distributors and oil companies are subject to the NEHG 2022.
 
The NEHG aims to cover emissions outside the EU ETS, encompassing predominantly emissions in the buildings and transport sectors. Between 2022 and 2025, the system will operate with an annually increasing fixed price and a flexible cap, such that more allowances will be available for entities if needed. The NEHG is being phased in gradually. The system has been designed in line with the reduction targets for non-EU ETS sectors as defined by the “European Effort Sharing Regulation” (ESR). The system may eventually transfer into the EU ETS 2. ","Austria is preparing for its NEHG to replace its national ETS with the EU ETS 2.

The federal backstop system consists of two components: a regulatory charge on fuels, and a baseline-and-credit ETS for emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industrial facilities called the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS).

To comply with the national system, provinces need to implement systems that meet the minimum national carbon price.

These include Chile’s NDC, Long-Term Climate Strategy, Climate Change Financial Strategy, and sectoral mitigation and adaptation plans. 

Article 14 of the law mandates the Ministry of Environment to specify GHG emissions limits set by technology, sector, or activity. GHG emissions limits may be set as emissions benchmarks for individual installations or in aggregate, for a group of installations or a sector. If set in aggregate, GHG emissions limits could be akin to a cap. According to Article 15, installations that perform better than their benchmark will have their surplus emissions reductions certified, which may then be used by other regulated entities for compliance with their respective emissions limits. 

The specific design of the emissions limits system is not yet defined and could be implemented either as an ETS or a tradable performance standard. In November 2023, the Ministry of Environment published the “Draft Rules for the Development of GHG Emissions and Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Limits” for public consultation. The document specifies procedures and characteristics of the emission limits to be developed under the Framework Law.

Based on Article 37 of the Law, which provides a basis for the development of market-based, fiscal, and financial instruments to address the negative impacts of GHG emissions, the country’s “2022-2026 Energy Agenda” states that a pilot ETS project for the energy sector will be developed. Work around this will be supported by the World Bank’s Partnership for Market Implementation.

Chile has had a carbon tax in place since 2017. The country’s “Long-Term Climate Strategy”, presented in October 2021, specifies that Chile will set an increasing trajectory for its carbon price between 2025 and 2030. It also specifies that the country seeks to have an integral carbon pricing portfolio to deliver coherent and predictable price signals. In line with this, the government launched its “National Energy Policy by 2050”, which states that carbon prices in Chile should reach USD 35/tCO2e by 2030 and USD 80/tCO2e by 2040.","In March 2024, the ""Rules for the Development of GHG Emissions Standards and Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Limits"" were approved by Chile's Council of Ministers for Sustainability and Climate Change.

It regulates more than 2,000 companies from the power sector with annual emissions of more than 26,000 tCO2, including combined heat and power, as well as captive power plants in other sectors. Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions, and allocation is based on intensity, with allowances freely allocated using benchmarks and based on actual production levels. Compliance obligations are currently limited and vary between different types of power generation. The system’s coverage will expand to other sectors over time. 
 
The national ETS builds on the experience of pilot carbon markets implemented in eight regions. These pilots continue to operate in parallel with the national ETS, covering sectors and entities not included in the national system. As the national system expands, entities covered by regional systems are expected to be integrated into it.
","The “Interim Regulations for the Management of Carbon Emissions Trading” (Interim Regulations), took effect from May 2024. It is intended to further enhance enforcement measures and non-compliance penalties for different stakeholders.

In March 2025, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) published “ The work plan of China National ETS covering the iron and steel, cement and aluminum industries”. It proposes expanding the ETS to also cover GHG Emissions from iron and steel, cement, and aluminum industries, over two phases. Phase 1 (2024 to 2026) aims to familiarize companies in these sectors with the national ETS and enhance emissions data quality. Companies will start to surrender allowances for emissions of 2024 by December 2025. Phase 2 (starting in 2027) aims to tighten and further improve the functioning of the system. This scope expansion, as being approved, brings an additional 1,500 companies into the Chinese national ETS, increasing the system’s emissions coverage by 3 billion tCO2e. Further details, including on allowance allocation methods, are expected to be published in the future.

In October 2024, the MEE released the allocation plan and compliance work plan for the power sector for 2023 and 2024. The allocation plan updates benchmarks and excludes indirect emissions. It also sets a rule on allowance carryover. According to this plan, the compliance is shifting from a two-years cycle to a one-year cycle. ","The ETS  initially only applies to CO2 emissions from the power sector, including combined heat and power and captive power plants from other sectors. ","Baselines (Intensity-based), Auctioning

Covered entities will have to surrender allowances for all their covered emissions. The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (Minambiente) will determine the number of allowances in line with Colombia’s national mitigation targets. Minambiente is also in charge of allocation, which will take place primarily via auctions. Non-compliance is to be punishable by a fine of up to double the auction price. Auction revenues, as updated by Article 262 of Law 2294 of 2023, will now be allocated to the “Fund for Life and Biodiversity” (formerly the “Fund for Sustainability and Climate Resilience”). These funds are designated for purposes set by the national carbon tax, as well as for administering the PNCTE and the Mandatory Emissions Report under Law 2169 of 2021. The Climate Change law also includes crediting provisions: voluntary actions of non-regulated entities that generate GHG emissions reductions or removals may be issued allowances if they are verified, certified, and registered in the National Emission Reductions Registry (Registro nacional de reducción de emisiones de GEI – Renare), and deemed eligible for the program.
The PNCTE will complement Colombia's revised carbon tax, according to Resolution 12 of 2023 by the National Directorate of Taxes and Customs. The 2018 “Climate Change Management Law” states that the government may recognize tonnes paid through the carbon tax as part of the compliance obligation of regulated entities under the PNCTE. 
The ETS design is currently being analyzed by the government. The 2021 “Climate Action Law” (Ley de Acción Climática) sets a goal to fully implement the ETS by 2030. This has also set an obligation for legal persons to report direct and indirect GHG emissions, following criteria to be set by Minambiente. It also appoints an independent group of experts (the Study Commission) to provide recommendations and promote and develop carbon markets in Colombia.

The EU ETS is currently in its fourth trading phase (2021 to 2030). Every year, covered entities must surrender allowances for their emissions under the EU ETS.

The reforms increased the ambition and expanded the scope of the EU ETS to maritime transport, and introduced a new, separate emissions trading system for buildings, road transport and additional sectors (called EU ETS 2). The reforms also established a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to address the risk of carbon leakage from specific sectors under the EU ETS (as an alternative to free allocation).

The package included important amendments to the EU ETS framework, including a proposal to extend emissions trading to new sectors. These amendments were adopted in the first half of 2023 and are now in force. 
 
A new, separate emissions trading system (ETS 2) will be established for emissions from fuels used for combustion in buildings, road transport and additional sectors (mainly small industry not covered by the existing EU ETS). The ETS 2 will complement other policies of the European Green Deal in the covered sectors, helping Member States achieve their emission reduction targets under the “Effort Sharing Regulation” (Regulation (EU) 2018/842).   
 
The ETS 2 is based on the ‘cap-and-trade’ principle. It will cover emissions upstream, meaning the obligation to surrender allowances will fall on the fuel suppliers rather than end-consumers. The ETS 2 cap will be set to bring emissions down by 42% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.  
 
The ETS 2 is due to become fully operational in 2027. As a first step, the monitoring and reporting of emissions from the covered sectors will start in 2025. To necessary rules were adopted in October 2023.  
  
A share of revenues from the ETS 2 will be used to support vulnerable households and micro-enterprises through a dedicated Social Climate Fund, created as part of the “Fit for 55” package.

ETS_IN,India ETS,ETS,Under development,India,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The government of India introduced an amendment to the “Energy Conservation Act, 2001”, providing a legal basis for the establishment of a Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) and issuance of carbon credit certificates. The amendment bill, incorporating these provisions, was passed in the Lower House (Lok Sabha) in August 2022, adopted, and subsequently passed in the Upper House (Rajya Sabha) in December 2022. The amendment bill provides the legal basis to establish a domestic carbon market (ICM) and grants the power to issue carbon credit certificates (CCCs) for the reduction of emissions.  
 
Following passage of the amendment, the government began work on the institutional and regulatory framework for the CCTS. The draft notification was published for stakeholder consultation in March 2023. Based on received comments, the notification was revised and officially issued in June 2023. 

Under the compliance mechanism, obligated entities will receive an annual emissions intensity target covering a three-year period, denominated in tCO2e per unit of product. New emissions intensity targets will be announced every three years to enable longer-term planning for covered entities. If an obligated entity overachieves its emissions intensity target, it can earn CCCs based on the difference between the achieved and the targeted emissions intensity. Entities that fail to achieve their targets will have to surrender/purchase a corresponding number of CCCs to ensure compliance and this will be achieved by facilitating trading among the obligated entities on a registry/trading platform. In this way the scheme will operate as a baseline-and-credit emissions trading scheme. 
 
The CCTS scope will include both direct emissions from fuel combustion and industrial processes, as well as indirect emissions from electricity and heat consumption. It will cover CO2, and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).  
 
The CCTS will be based on the existing Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme – a mandatory energy efficiency scheme covering more than 1,000 entities from 13 energy-intensive sectors – that should be gradually transitioned into a compliance carbon market.

It is expected that a phased transition from the current PAT scheme to the compliance mechanism under CCTS will begin in 2024. The compliance mechanism will be jointly managed by the Ministry of Power, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, and the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE). 
 
In December 2023, the government amended the CCTS notification, introducing provisions for the offset mechanism to support non-obligated entities and promote mitigation efforts, encompassing  a comprehensive approach for GHG reduction. The government is actively working to operationalize both the compliance and offset mechanisms. ","In July 2024, India's government adopted regulations for the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), clarifying that it will take the form of an intensity-based trading system covering nine sectors",,Baselines (intensity),,

The ongoing work on establishing a registry and MRV system has progressed to the implementation phase. 
 
Pakistan launched the National Committee on Establishment of Carbon Markets (NCEC) in December 2019, which coordinated ministerial activities on carbon pricing. Among other responsibilities, the one-year committee was tasked with assessing the role and scope of carbon markets in delivering Pakistan’s NDC and identifying opportunities for and challenges to improving emissions data. The NCEC reviewed existing carbon market designs, deliberated with national stakeholders, and coordinated information-sharing and capacity-building activities. The MoCC&EC is currently advancing the work in these areas under the World Bank’s PMI program where the initial mapping exercise has led to the implementation of activities contributing to four broad outcomes. The country will initiate work on: 1) domestic carbon pricing policy; 2) international carbon market to operationalize Article 6; 3) an MRV framework; and 4) knowledge management/capacity building under the current support in next five years. 
 
Besides a domestic ETS, Pakistan aims to launch credit-based trading mechanisms linked to international carbon markets, which would enable it to supply offset credits to partner countries.

The overall aim of the roadmap is to ensure that Sakhalin achieves carbon neutrality by 2025, and includes plans for a pilot carbon trading system.  
 
In 2022, the State Duma approved a “Federal Law on Conducting an Experiment to Limit GHG Emissions in Selected Federal States of the Russian Federation”, introducing mandatory emissions reporting and verification requirements for regulated entities and obliging them to comply with the allocated emissions allowances. The law also sets a legal basis for allowance circulation between entities. 

The Sakhalin government approved a list of 50 regulated entities for the new ETS, emitting at least 20,000 tCO2 per year, in 2022, and a carbon registry started operating in test mode in September that year. The first compliance period is set to start in 2024. Covered entities will have to surrender allowances for all their covered emissions, and allocation is expected to be based on free allocation.  
 
In 2023, regulated entities submitted their first verified emissions reports for 2022, which became the basis for setting individual caps for 35 entities in September 2023.  ",,,,,

Emissions limits are based on production levels multiplied by an emissions intensity value. Each facility’s baseline draws on historical emissions and production data. All emissions up until the limit do not require payment, with only the surplus triggering the compliance obligation.

Starting from 2013, the ETS became mandatory for large energy-intensive industries and medium-sized industries could voluntarily join. Participants in the ETS continue to be exempted from the CO2 levy. On January 1, 2020, the linking of the Swiss and EU ETS came into force.  Ratification of the agreement by the EU and Switzerland was announced on December 12, 2019 and followed legislative revisions required for the Swiss ETS to be compatible with the EU ETS and comply with the agreement. With the linking agreement now in effect, covered entities in the Switzerland ETS can use allowances from the EU ETS for compliance, and vice versa. However, the two systems run separate auctions. The revised ‘Ordinance on the Reduction of CO2 Emissions (CO2 Ordinance),’ was adopted in November 2020, which embedded the new legal base for the Swiss ETS into the partially revised “CO2 Act” – the core framework of Switzerland’s climate legislation – that entered into force in January 2021.
","After a revision of the CO2 Act failed to pass a referendum in June 2021, the Swiss Parliament extended the current CO2 Act to 2024. This included the target to reduce emissions by 1.5% per year compared to 1990 levels. In November 2022, the Swiss Federal Council published a new proposal for a revision of the CO2 Act that covers the period from 2025 to 2030, including Switzerland’s 50% emission reduction target for 2030. The proposal includes provisions to align the Swiss ETS with the revised EU ETS.

Taiwan, China, enacted the “GHG Reduction and Management Act” (the Act) in 2015, which legislates a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050 compared to 2005 levels. It also mandates regulatory mitigation goals to be set in stages. The Act further stipulates that the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA) will implement a domestic cap-and-trade scheme. This is further referred to in the “Climate Change Action Guideline 2017”.  
 
The Act also mandated TEPA to develop a “GHG Reduction Action Plan”, which was published in 2018. This plan outlines strategies for mitigation policies; it includes five-year regulatory goals for national and sectoral GHG emissions and eight policy implementation packages. The plan also proposes to implement a cap-and-trade system, calculate baseline emissions, and establish regulations – although there is no precise timeline. 

Subsidiary regulations are also in place. Mandatory emissions reporting for entities with annual emissions above 25,000 tCO2e from certain sectors has been in place since 2014.

The intention to develop an ETS has also been reflected in Türkiye’s annual Medium-Term Programs (MTPs) since 2022. Moreover, the high-level planning outlined in the 12th Turkish Development Plan (2024 to 2028) takes the year 2053 as a long-term reference in the country’s green and digital transformation agenda and considers the TR ETS as an instrument of this transformation.  ","Türkiye released its long-term strategy during COP 29, which references a pilot ETS expected to launch in 2026",,,,

Issues related to climate change are addressed in Article 365 (c) Title V and in an annex to the agreement, which outlines steps for the implementation of a national ETS 

The country has since established a national MRV system, with its scope partially covering activities similar to EU ETS activities, to provide a solid basis for the upcoming ETS. Since 2021, the MRV procedures as adopted in the framework law on MRV have been applied by regulated installations. To establish its ETS, Ukraine plans to develop separate legislation based on at least three years of data from the MRV system. According to a statement made by the Minister of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources in October 2023, the ETS may be launched in a pilot mode in 2025.  

In 2022, covered installations were supposed to submit first monitoring reports for 2021. However, from 2022, due to the ongoing war in the country, the MRV system is implemented on a voluntary basis. Draft instruments for cap-setting and allowance allocation were developed, and a stakeholder engagement process was also carried out in 2022 to early 2023.  
 

","In October 2024, the Law on Basic Principles of State Climate Policy was approved by the Ukrainian Parliament, which mandates the establishment of an emssions trading system with an absolute cap on covered sector emissions

Verified emissions from stationary UK ETS operators currently cover around a quarter of the UK’s territorial GHG emissions. The first phase of the UK ETS runs until 2030. 
 
The UK ETS covers around 1,000 installations in the power and industrial sectors, as well as around 400 aircraft operators. Aviation activity covered includes flights within the UK as well as flights departing the UK to the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland. Covered installations and aircraft operators must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions. Allowances are allocated primarily through auctioning, with a portion freely allocated to mitigate the risk of carbon leakage. The system has both a cost containment mechanism (CCM) and auction reserve price, to support market stability.  
 
The UK government remains open to the possibility of linking the UK ETS to other systems, if such a link would be advantageous for both systems. ","The UK ETS cap was reset in January 2024 to align with the UK's net zero target by 2050. This includes a 30% reduction in available allowances between 2021 and 2030. 

Two consultations were launched in May 2024 related to scope expansion for waste (waste incineration or waste-to-energy) from 2028 onwards. 

To address the risk of carbon leakage, the UK Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (UK CBAM) will enter into force in January 2027, the UK government confirmed in October 2024.

The UK launched two further consultations on scope expansion in November 2024, for maritime activities and pipeline transport for carbon capture and storage.
 
The UK ETS Authority has also announced its intention to cover emissions from domestic maritime activities from 2026, and from waste incineration and waste from energy from 2028 (preceded by a two-year MRV-only period from 2026 to 2028). 
 
Further consultation on bringing additional sectors into the UK ETS and incorporation of GGRs is anticipated.

The UK government has indicated it is open to the possibility of internationally linking the scheme in the future but has not made any decision on preferred linking partners. The post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and UK stipulates that the jurisdictions “shall give serious consideration to linking their respective carbon pricing systems in a way that preserves the integrity of these systems and provides for the possibility to increase their effectiveness”.

This law establishes a mandate for the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) and the Ministry of Finance to design a national crediting mechanism (NCM) and a domestic ETS. The framework legislation also empowers MONRE to set the ETS cap and determine the method of allowance allocation. It also allows for the inclusion of domestic and international offset credits in the ETS. 
 
“Decree 06/2022/ND-CP” outlines a roadmap for the implementation of the NCM and the ETS. The decree requires facilities with annual GHG emissions above 3,000 tCO2e to submit a biennial inventory report of their emissions from 2025 onwards. The accompanying “Decision 01/2022/QD-TTg” lists the sectors and facilities with emissions inventory obligations.  
 
Decree 06 also includes provisions for developing a national ETS, focusing initially on the steel, cement, and thermal power sectors, with a declining cap that corresponds to Vietnam’s NDC. The roadmap for the ETS states that regulations and a trading platform should be in place by 2025. A pilot ETS is planned for 2027-. The ETS should be implemented from 2030, and provisions will allow for participation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

The program covers around 150 entities in the energy, industrial, buildings, and transport sectors. Many of the cap-and-invest program’s design elements are similar to those of California’s cap-and-trade program.  Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions. Allowances are distributed through auctioning and free allocation, with the latter based primarily on benchmarking.
