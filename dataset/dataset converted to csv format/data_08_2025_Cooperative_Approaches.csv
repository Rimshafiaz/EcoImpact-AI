Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement sets out the framework for international compliance carbon market where Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) are traded bilaterally with corresponding adjustment (CA) under cooperative approaches. Corresponding adjustment is a procedure established under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to avoid double counting. A selling (host) country that authorizes the transfer of mitigation outcomes must increase its reported emissions by the amount transferred. Carbon credits transferred with a CA cannot be counted toward the host/seller country’s NDC.,,,,
"Note: Agreements signed by Japan and Australia with seller countries as part of JCM and IPCOS respectively are not included in this list but instead under government crediting mechanisms, because while these agreements are Article 6-aligned, they are not explicitly Article 6.2 agreements. With JCM, there are several agreements that pre-date Paris Agreement and credits / ITMOs generated as part of the mechanism will be shared by both Japan and seller country.",,,,
