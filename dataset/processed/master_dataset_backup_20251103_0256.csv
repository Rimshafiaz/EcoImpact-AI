It covers large emitting facilities, with the ability for lower emitting facilities to opt in to the regulation. 
 
Covered entities must reduce their emissions intensity (emissions per unit of production) by a set percentage each year. The reduction requirement is based on a facility’s average emissions intensity over a three-year historic period or compared to a sector-specific benchmark. Covered entities that outperform their targets generate emissions performance credits (EPCs), which can be sold or used in future compliance years. Those that exceed their limits are required to provide compensation by either (1) purchasing EPCs from other covered facilities, (2) paying into the TIER fund to purchase a fund credit for each tonne of excess emissions, or (3) purchasing emission offset credits generated within Alberta under an approved offset protocol or sequestration credits. ","Alberta’s Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) Regulation was amended in December 2022, with changes taking effect on January 1, 2023. Updates included setting the carbon price in line with the federal benchmark; tightening output-based benchmarks by 2% annually from 2023 to 2030 and also increasing the tightening rates of the oil sands sectors by 4% in 2029 and 2030; reducing the opt-in threshold to 2,000 tonne  per year; increasing the limits on emission performance and offsets usage from 60% in 2023 by 10% annually until it reaches 90% in 2026; reducing the credit expiry to five years; establishing sequestration credits and capture recognition tonnes  to support carbon capture, utilization, and storage investments; and changing the biomass emissions treatment to support bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.
","Alberta’s TIER Regulation applies to all greenhouse gas emissions from facilities that emit 100 ktCO2-e/year or more, including industry, power, food processing, waste and other sectors. Smaller conventional oil and gas facilities can aggregate and opt-in to the regulation. Lower emitting facilities (those emitting 2,000 tonnes CO2e or more per year) can opt-in to the regulation.

Facility-level baselines are calculated using output-based benchmarking based on emissions intensity.  
 
Facilities emitting above their baseline must offset excess emissions by surrendering Safeguard Mechanism Credits (SMCs) or Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs). In some cases, facilities can also apply to average their emissions over a longer period or borrow from a future year.  
 
The Safeguard Mechanism was introduced in 2016 but had not been classified as a baseline-and-credit system as no tradeable permits were issued. However, as of July 2023, the government issues SMCs to facilities that over-achieve on their baseline. This reform was accompanied by a tightening of baselines and a default decline rate of 4.9% per year, to align the outcome with Australia’s 2030 targets.
","Legislation to reform the Safeguard Mechanism was passed in March 2023, with changes entering into force from July 2023. The Safeguard Mechanism now assigns emissions baselines to over 200 large facilities, with those emitting above their baseline required to offset excess emissions. The reforms tightened emissions baselines for covered facilities and now allow the issuance of credits to facilities that overachieve on their baseline. This in effect turned the Safeguard Mechanism into a baseline-and-credit system. 
","The Safeguard Mechanism covers all direct (scope 1) GHG emissions from facilities emitting over 100kt CO2-e/year in electricity, mining, oil and gas production, manufacturing, transport and waste. Grid-connected electricity facilities are covered by one combined ‘sectoral’ baseline and it is not expected that the sectoral baseline will ever be breached.

Although the NEHG does not establish a carbon tax, the carbon pricing instrument follows in central parts the logic of existing energy taxes (fuel tax, coal tax, and natural gas tax). Thus, if a certain event is taxable under the existing energy taxes regime, an obligation to buy allowances arises under the NEHG. Taxable events are the production, import, or release of energy products from a tax warehouse in Austria or the supply of coal and natural gas to consumers. In practice, only a limited number of energy distributors and oil companies are subject to the NEHG 2022.
 
The NEHG aims to cover emissions outside the EU ETS, encompassing predominantly emissions in the buildings and transport sectors. Between 2022 and 2025, the system will operate with an annually increasing fixed price and a flexible cap, such that more allowances will be available for entities if needed. The NEHG is being phased in gradually. The system has been designed in line with the reduction targets for non-EU ETS sectors as defined by the “European Effort Sharing Regulation” (ESR). The system may eventually transfer into the EU ETS 2. ","Austria is preparing for its NEHG to replace its national ETS with the EU ETS 2. Austria's request to ""opt-in"" sectors not covered in the European system was approved in December 2024. The Austria ETS will therefore conclude in December 2026","The Austria ETS applies to fossil fuels used in the transport, buildings, agriculture, and energy sectors, as well as from small industries. This essentially concerns the following fossil energy sources: petrol, gasoil (diesel), heating oil, natural gas, liquefied gas, coal, and kerosene. Fuels in admixture with biogenic fuels receive a lower emissions factor than purely fossil fuels. ENtities that would be liable for less than 1 tonne of CO2e per year are excluded.

In May, BEE, which manages Beijing ETS, released a notice on the “Management of Key Carbon Emission Units and the Work of Carbon Emissions Trading in 2024”, which included several documents on MRV, allowance allocation, and offset credits.  In this document, BEE sets the compliance deadline for 2023 emissions to November 15, 2024.

A federal carbon pricing backstop system comes into effect, in whole or in part in any province or territory that requested it or that does not have a price on carbon in place that meets the federal standard. The federal backstop system consists of two components: a regulatory charge on fuels, and a baseline-and-credit ETS for emissions-intensive and trade-exposed industrial facilities called the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS).

To comply with the national system, provinces need to implement systems that meet the minimum national carbon price. The minimum national carbon price was set at CAD 65 (USD 48.15) in 2023, increasing by CAD 15 (USD 11.11) each year to reach CAD 170 (USD 125.93) in 2030.

It regulates more than 2,000 companies from the power sector with annual emissions of more than 26,000 tCO2, including combined heat and power, as well as captive power plants in other sectors. Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions, and allocation is based on intensity, with allowances freely allocated using benchmarks and based on actual production levels. Compliance obligations are currently limited and vary between different types of power generation. The system’s coverage will expand to other sectors over time. 
 
The national ETS builds on the experience of pilot carbon markets implemented in eight regions. These pilots continue to operate in parallel with the national ETS, covering sectors and entities not included in the national system. As the national system expands, entities covered by regional systems are expected to be integrated into it.
","The “Interim Regulations for the Management of Carbon Emissions Trading” (Interim Regulations), took effect from May 2024. It is intended to further enhance enforcement measures and non-compliance penalties for different stakeholders.

In March 2025, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) published “ The work plan of China National ETS covering the iron and steel, cement and aluminum industries”. It proposes expanding the ETS to also cover GHG Emissions from iron and steel, cement, and aluminum industries, over two phases. Phase 1 (2024 to 2026) aims to familiarize companies in these sectors with the national ETS and enhance emissions data quality. Companies will start to surrender allowances for emissions of 2024 by December 2025. Phase 2 (starting in 2027) aims to tighten and further improve the functioning of the system. This scope expansion, as being approved, brings an additional 1,500 companies into the Chinese national ETS, increasing the system’s emissions coverage by 3 billion tCO2e. Further details, including on allowance allocation methods, are expected to be published in the future.

In October 2024, the MEE released the allocation plan and compliance work plan for the power sector for 2023 and 2024. The allocation plan updates benchmarks and excludes indirect emissions. It also sets a rule on allowance carryover. According to this plan, the compliance is shifting from a two-years cycle to a one-year cycle.

It is a cornerstone instrument of the EU’s policy framework to combat climate change under the “European Green Deal” and reduce GHG emissions cost-effectively. The EU ETS is currently in its fourth trading phase (2021 to 2030). Every year, covered entities must surrender allowances for their emissions under the EU ETS. Auctioning is the main method of distributing allowances, with free allocation, based on benchmarks, used to address carbon leakage. ","The EU has adopted a number of reforms to the EU ETS as part of the “Fit for 55” package to align the system with the EU’s 2030 climate target of at least 55% net emissions reductions compared to 1990 levels and the European Green Deal objectives. The reforms increased the ambition and expanded the scope of the EU ETS to maritime transport, and introduced a new, separate emissions trading system for buildings, road transport and additional sectors (called EU ETS 2). The reforms also established a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to address the risk of carbon leakage from specific sectors under the EU ETS (as an alternative to free allocation). ","The EU ETS applies to direct (scope 1) emissions from activities in the power sector, manufacturing, industry, and intra-EU aviation (including flights from the EEA to the United Kingdom). The EU ETS covers CO2 emissions, and emissions of other gases from certain activities. Each sector or activity has a specific threshold for participation.

Recent reforms to the scheme expanded its scope to maritime transport, and introduced a new, separate emissions trading system for buildings, road transport and additional sectors (EU ETS 2)","Free allocation (Intensity-based), Auctioning",Annual,The EU ETS has been linked with the Switzerland ETS since 2020.

With the introduction of the ETS, a wide range of sectors in Germany are now subject to a carbon price.  
 
The national ETS complements the EU ETS by covering all fuel emissions not covered by the bloc’s system. It is being phased in gradually, with an increasing fixed price per tCO2 from 2021 to 2025. 

During the fixed price and price corridor phases, the cap is flexible. Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions, and allocation is based on auctions or free allocation. 
 
The national ETS was established through the 2019 “Fuel Emissions Trading Act” 2019, which was amended in 2020, 2022 and again in 2023. 
","A law was passed by the German parliament in February 2025 which will transition the Germany ETS (nETS) into the EU ETS2, when it comes into effect in 2027. The waste sector, added in 2024, will remain in the nETS until its conclusion in December 2026","All main fuel types (gasoline, diesel, heating oil, natural and liquid gases) have been covered from the outset, while other fuels such as coal and the incineration of waste will gradually be phased in by the end of 2024.

 Emissions from biogenic fuels that meet the sustainability criteria as set out in national regulations transposing the “European Renewable Energy Directives 2029/28/EC” and “2018/2001” do not face compliance obligations. 

The system started with a limited scope in 2021 and 2022, including fuel oil, LPG, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel. Coal was added in 2023.

In its first phase spanning from 2023 to 2024, it exclusively targets coal-fired power plants connected to the Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) grid with a capacity of 25 MW or more. For 2023, the ETS covered 99 coal-fired power plants, estimated to represent around 81.4 % of the country’s power generation capacity.

Covered entities are required to surrender allowances corresponding to all their covered emissions, with allocation based on PTBAE (intensity targets), emission intensity, and emission average. Additionally, entities have the option to purchase allowances via auctions.  ","The scope of Indonesia's ETS was expanded to include an additional 47 coal-fired power plants. From 2025 onwards, additional power plants will join the ETS
","Initially, coal-fired power generation facilities with a production capacity exceeding 100 MW are included. However, smaller coal and fossil fuel plants may be incorporated at a later point.

The Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF) has indicated that the government plans to implement emission caps for four additional sectors in the future: forestry, industrial processes and product use, agriculture, and waste management.

In August 2016, Mexico, Québec, and Ontario issued a joint declaration on carbon markets collaboration.

This regulation establishes a national ETS covering emissions from the industrial and power sectors. It includes provisions for banking allowances, a minimum reserve price of EUR 24 (USD 26.08), and a linear reduction factor for the emissions cap of 1.5% annually in the period from 2020 to 2030.  
  
The ETS formally began operations in February 2020 and applies to three installations: the Pljevlja coal plant, the KAP aluminium plant, and the Tosčelik steel mill. Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions, and allocation is based on auctions or free allocation. They received 100% of their allowances for free in 2020 and 2021. For 2022, 64% of all allowances were auctioned. ","The operation of the Montenegro ETS was negatively affected by several changes of government in the past two years, which caused major delays in the adoption of the yearly allocation plan. In addition, two of the three covered installations shut down their operations in 2022 in response to rapidly rising energy prices. This is still the case as of January 2024, leaving the Pljevlja coal plant as the only operational covered entity.  
 
The Montenegro government set up a working group in mid-2022 to review the country’s climate legislation, including the ETS. This work was concluded in December 2024 and sent to the Legislative Secretariat for its opinion.","Industries listed under Appendix 1 of the “ETS Decree must participate in the system. These include power plants, oil refineries, coke production, the production or processing of iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, cement clinker, glass, ceramic products, and paper (pulp).

Covered entities must surrender allowances for all their reported emissions.  

The NZ ETS was originally designed to operate without a specific hard domestic cap as this accommodated carbon sequestration from forestry activities and a full link to the international Kyoto Protocol carbon markets, but in 2015 the allowance supply was restricted to NZUs. The NZ ETS was originally conceived as a nested system under the Kyoto Protocol, with full links to international carbon markets. However, as of June 1 2015, the NZ ETS became a domestic-only system. In 2024, the cap is 27.9 MtCO2e. 

Extensive legislative reforms of the NZ ETS were implemented in 2020.","In 2024 legislation to include agricultural emissions in the NZ ETS was repealed, and the government instead plans to price agricultural emissions through a different mechanism no later than 2030. A report on the latest science related to biogenic methane was delivered to ministers in December 2024, for consideration by the Climate Change Commission in 2025. The cap was reduced from 27.9 million in 2024 to 19.1 million in 2025. The auction reserve price floor for 2025 is set at NZD 69, with a first CCR trigger price of NZD 193.","The NZ ETS applies to GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs and PFCs) from the industry, power, waste, transport and forestry sectors and includes industrial process emissions.

The Nova Scotia OBPS was approved by the Canadian federal government in November 2022 and began operating in 2023. It replaced Nova Scotia’s cap-and-trade program, which had been in place since 2019 but was officially phased out after the final compliance deadline in December 2023. 
   
Covered entities must surrender allowances (compliance units) for emissions that exceed the facility’s annual emissions limit. The annual emissions limit is based on an emissions intensity benchmark. If a facility’s emissions are below its limit, it earns performance credits (compliance units), which can be banked for future use or sold.  ",The Nova Scotia government released final regulations for performance standards and reporting in January 2024,"The Nova Scotia OBPS sets facility-level emissions-intensity standards (performance standards) for electricity generators and large industrial emitters. 

The Nova Scotia OBPS is mandatory for facilities with annual emissions equal to or more than 50,000 tCO2e. Other facilities under this threshold with annual emissions of  ≥10,000 tCO2e/year have the option to voluntarily join the system. If not, they would be subject to the Canada federal fuel charge.

Initially launched in 2022, the CPP aimed to reduce GHGs in the state and deliver benefits to Oregon communities. The CPP established a declining cap on regulated emissions for covered entities, which included natural gas utilities (referred to as ""local distribution companies"") and non-natural gas fuel suppliers. The cap for 2024 was set to cover ~40% of the state’s emissions, and planned to reduce each year, to reach 90% below 2017-2019 emissions levels by 2050. 
 
Covered entities were allocated yearly allowances based on their emissions. Additionally, the program permitted these companies to meet up to 10% of their emissions reduction obligations using compliance offset credits sourced from within Oregon, a threshold planned to increase to 20% over time.

Québec has been a member of the Western Climate Initiative (WCI) since 2008 and formally linked its system with California’s in 2014.  ","In 2024 Quebec worked to prepare draft regulations to refine its cap-and-trade program, expected to be published in 2025. Proposed amendments to the system include changing the supply of emissions units, adjusting offset credit limits, increasing reserve prices, modifying compliance periods to align with 2030 and 2050 targets.

It started operating with ten states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont). RGGI’s development was based on the “2005 RGGI Memorandum of Understanding” (MOU) and on the “2006 RGGI Model Rule”. Through statutes or regulations based on the Model Rule, each state then established individual CO2budget trading programs.
 
RGGI covers power sector emissions in participating states. In 2020, it covered around 14% of the aggregate participant states’ emissions; in 2021, 228 facilities were covered by the state regulations. The aggregate cap will decrease by 30% compared to 2020 between 2021 and 2030. Under the ETS, covered entities must surrender allowances for all their covered emissions. Covered entities obtain most of their allowances through regular auctions, while some states have “set-aside” accounts from which they may transfer a limited number of allowances to entities’ compliance accounts.  ","Virginia repealed its CO2 Budget Trading Program, which effectively ended RGGI participation in December 2023. However, a Viginia circuit court decision in November 2024 deemed the repeal unlawful. RGGI has undergone two review processes that updated the Model Rule and enshrined tighter caps and adjustments to system design. RGGI’s third review process is currently ongoing. In September 2024 RGGI states released an exploratory scenario with new cap reductions trajectories, with a steeper decline in the cap from 2027-2033 followed by a lessening decline from 2033 to 2037.

It is an emission intensity-based baseline-and-credit ETS for large industrial emitters, in which covered entities are required to fulfill a compliance obligation for emissions that exceed the facility’s annual permitted emissions. Emissions limits are based on production levels multiplied by an emissions intensity value. Each facility’s baseline draws on historical emissions and production data. All emissions up until the limit do not require payment, with only the surplus triggering the compliance obligation. 

A compliance obligation may be fulfilled by retiring performance credits (compliance units) generated within the OBPS Program or by making a payment at a prescribed rate per tonne of CO2e into the Saskatchewan Technology Fund.

The total amount of emission allowances is determined top-down and decreases annually. The ETS started in 2008 with a five-year phase during which companies could voluntarily join as an alternative to facing the Switzerland carbon tax (CO2 levy on fossil fuels). Starting from 2013, the ETS became mandatory for large energy-intensive industries and medium-sized industries could voluntarily join. Participants in the ETS continue to be exempted from the CO2 levy. On January 1, 2020, the linking of the Swiss and EU ETS came into force.  Ratification of the agreement by the EU and Switzerland was announced on December 12, 2019 and followed legislative revisions required for the Swiss ETS to be compatible with the EU ETS and comply with the agreement. With the linking agreement now in effect, covered entities in the Switzerland ETS can use allowances from the EU ETS for compliance, and vice versa. However, the two systems run separate auctions. The revised ‘Ordinance on the Reduction of CO2 Emissions (CO2 Ordinance),’ was adopted in November 2020, which embedded the new legal base for the Swiss ETS into the partially revised “CO2 Act” – the core framework of Switzerland’s climate legislation – that entered into force in January 2021.
","After a revision of the CO2 Act failed to pass a referendum in June 2021, the Swiss Parliament extended the current CO2 Act to 2024. This included the target to reduce emissions by 1.5% per year compared to 1990 levels. In November 2022, the Swiss Federal Council published a new proposal for a revision of the CO2 Act that covers the period from 2025 to 2030, including Switzerland’s 50% emission reduction target for 2030. The proposal includes provisions to align the Swiss ETS with the revised EU ETS.
 
In November 2023, the EU and Switzerland concluded the 2024 emission allowance transfer arrangements between their systems. From January 2024, daily transfers, with exceptions for specific dates, replaced the previous twice-weekly schedule. Details on the 2025 arrangements are anticipated by the end of 2024. ","The Switzerland ETS applies to GHG emissions (CO2, NO2, CH4, HFCs, NF3, SF6 and PFCs) from fuel use in the industry, power and aviation sectors and industrial process emissions.","Free allocation (Intensity-based), Auctioning
",Annual,"Switzerland's ETS has been linked with the EU ETS since January 2020. Prior to that, revisions were made to align with the EU ETS legislative framework.
 
Covered entities in the Swiss ETS can use allowances from the EU ETS for compliance, and vice versa. The two systems run separate auctions. Market participants from the EEA need an account in the Swiss Emissions Trading Register in order to participate. Allowance transfers between the EU and Swiss registries are generally executed bi-monthly on pre-announced dates. 


In 2024, allowance transfers between the EU and Swiss registries will be executed on a daily basis, with specific exceptions for certain dates.

In August, Tianjin launched a public consultation on “Tianjin Work Plan for Expanding the Scope of the Coverage of the Local Carbon Emissions Trading Market,” where the government proposed including maritime, domestic aviation and data centers into the current ETS scope. The public consultation ended in early September 2024, and final decisions are to be announced. The proposed scope expansion is anticipated to apply to 150 entities, covering an additional 300 MtCO2 of emissions annually.

Two consultations were launched in May 2024 related to scope expansion for waste (waste incineration or waste-to-energy) from 2028 onwards. 

To address the risk of carbon leakage, the UK Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (UK CBAM) will enter into force in January 2027, the UK government confirmed in October 2024.

The UK launched two further consultations on scope expansion in November 2024, for maritime activities and pipeline transport for carbon capture and storage.
 
The UK ETS Authority has also announced its intention to cover emissions from domestic maritime activities from 2026, and from waste incineration and waste from energy from 2028 (preceded by a two-year MRV-only period from 2026 to 2028). 
 
Further consultation on bringing additional sectors into the UK ETS and incorporation of GGRs is anticipated.
